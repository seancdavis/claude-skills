# Claude Skills Plugin

A Claude Code plugin containing web development skills for Astro and Vite+React projects deployed to Netlify.

## Installation

### Option 1: Global Installation (All Projects)

Add this repository as a marketplace, then install the plugin:

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add seancdavis/claude-skills

# Install plugin (choose "user" scope for global)
/plugin install seancdavis-skills
```

### Option 2: Per-Project Installation

For a specific project, install with "project" or "local" scope:

```bash
# Add marketplace (if not already added)
/plugin marketplace add seancdavis/claude-skills

# Install for this project only
/plugin install seancdavis-skills
# Select "project" (shared via git) or "local" (not shared)
```

### Option 3: Local Development/Testing

Run Claude Code with the plugin directory:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/claude-skills
```

## Usage

Once installed, skills are available with the `seancdavis-skills:` namespace:

```
/seancdavis-skills:new-project
/seancdavis-skills:astro-best-practices
/seancdavis-skills:auth-design
```

Claude will also automatically invoke skills based on context.

## Skill Development

### SKILL.md Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Comprehensive description - this determines when Claude invokes the skill
---
```

### Optional Frontmatter

- `disable-model-invocation: true` - Only user can invoke
- `user-invocable: false` - Only Claude can invoke (background knowledge)
- `allowed-tools` - Restrict available tools

### Guidelines

- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Move detailed reference material to `references/` directory
- Description must include all trigger conditions (not the body)
- Avoid redundant intro paragraphs that repeat the description
- Start body with first actionable section, not overview text

## Development Workflow

- Test locally: `claude --plugin-dir .`
- Commit after each meaningful change
- Use Prettier for formatting
