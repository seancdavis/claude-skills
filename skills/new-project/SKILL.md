name: new-project
description: Orchestrates creating new web application projects for Sean. Use when starting a new project from scratch. Handles framework selection (Astro vs Vite+React), scaffolding, GitHub repo creation, Netlify setup instructions, and generates project CLAUDE.md. This is the entry point for all new projects.

# New Project Skill

This skill orchestrates the creation of new web application projects. It guides through framework selection, scaffolding, and infrastructure setup.

---

## Phase 1: Planning

Before writing any code, gather requirements and make architectural decisions.

### Framework Decision Matrix

| Choose Astro when... | Choose Vite + React when... |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Content-heavy site (blog, docs, marketing) | Highly interactive app (dashboard, tool) |
| Mostly read-only data display | Frequent data input and updates |
| ~95% of UI has no interactions beyond clicking | Real-time updates or complex state |
| SEO is critical | Client-side state management needed |
| Progressive enhancement desired | Heavy client-side logic |

**Default to Astro** unless there's a clear need for constant interactivity.

### Data Storage Decision

| Use Netlify Blobs when... | Use Netlify DB when... |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Only storing files | Storing structured data |
| Handful of records, no growth expected | Data will grow over time |
| No relational needs | Need queries, filtering, relations |
| Want zero third-party dependencies | Need SQL capabilities |

**Default to Netlify DB** for most non-trivial applications.

### Questions to Clarify

1. What is the primary purpose of this app?
2. How interactive is the main experience?
3. Will users be creating/editing data frequently?
4. Who are the users? (Just Sean, specific people, public?)
5. Does it need authentication?
6. What data needs to be stored?

---

## Phase 2: Pre-Build Setup

### Step 1: Scaffold the Project

**For Astro:**
```bash
# Create new Astro project
npm create astro@latest {project-name} -- --template minimal --typescript strict

cd {project-name}

# Add integrations
npx astro add netlify react tailwind
```

**For Vite + React:**
```bash
# Create new Vite project
npm create vite@latest {project-name} -- --template react-ts

cd {project-name}

# Install dependencies
npm install react-router-dom
npm install -D @netlify/vite-plugin @netlify/functions @tailwindcss/vite tailwindcss
```

### Step 2: Configure the Project

**Astro - astro.config.mjs:**
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import netlify from "@astrojs/netlify";
import react from "@astrojs/react";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  output: "server",
  adapter: netlify(),
  integrations: [react()],
  vite: {
    plugins: [tailwindcss()],
  },
});
```

**Vite + React - vite.config.ts:**
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
import netlify from '@netlify/vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss(), netlify()],
})
```

### Step 3: Configure package.json scripts

**Astro:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "netlify dev --no-open",
    "build": "astro build",
    "preview": "astro preview"
  }
}
```

**Vite + React:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc -b && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Create netlify.toml

**Astro:**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[dev]
  command = "astro dev"
  targetPort = 4321
```

**Vite + React:**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"
  functions = "netlify/functions"

[dev]
  command = "npm run dev"
  targetPort = 5173
```

### Step 5: Initialize Git and Create GitHub Repo

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"

# Create GitHub repo (uses gh CLI)
gh repo create {project-name} --private --source=. --push
```

---

## Phase 3: Manual Setup (User Action Required)

**STOP HERE** and instruct Sean to complete these steps:

### Required Steps

1. **Create Netlify Site**
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Select the GitHub repo just created
   - Deploy with default settings

2. **Link Local Project**
   ```bash
   netlify link
   ```

3. **Initialize Database (if using Netlify DB)**
   ```bash
   netlify db init
   ```
   - This provisions a Neon database
   - Sets up Drizzle ORM automatically

4. **Claim the Neon Database**
   - Follow the prompt from `netlify db init`
   - Or go to Netlify Dashboard → Site → Neon tab

**Wait for Sean to confirm these steps are complete before proceeding.**

---

## Phase 4: Build

After Sean confirms setup is complete:

### If Using Netlify DB

1. **Configure Drizzle for timestamp migrations:**

```typescript
// drizzle.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'drizzle-kit';

export default defineConfig({
  dialect: 'postgresql',
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL!
  },
  schema: './db/schema.ts',
  out: './migrations',
  migrations: {
    prefix: 'timestamp'
  }
});
```

2. **Add database scripts to package.json:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:generate": "drizzle-kit generate",
    "db:migrate": "netlify dev:exec drizzle-kit migrate",
    "db:migrate:prod": "node scripts/migrate-production.js --production",
    "db:studio": "netlify dev:exec drizzle-kit studio"
  }
}
```

3. **Create production migration script:**

```javascript
// scripts/migrate-production.js
import { execSync } from 'child_process';
import readline from 'readline';

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

console.log('\n⚠️  PRODUCTION DATABASE MIGRATION\n');
console.log('This will run migrations against the PRODUCTION database.');
console.log('Make sure you are on the main branch and have pulled latest.\n');

rl.question('Type the project name to confirm: ', (answer) => {
  if (answer === '{project-name}') {
    console.log('\nRunning production migration...\n');
    execSync('netlify exec drizzle-kit migrate', { stdio: 'inherit' });
  } else {
    console.log('\nMigration cancelled.');
  }
  rl.close();
});
```

### Generate CLAUDE.md

Use the `claude-md-template` skill to generate the project's CLAUDE.md file based on the chosen technologies.

### Apply Relevant Skills

Based on the project requirements, implement patterns from:

- `astro-best-practices` or `vite-best-practices`
- `auth-design` (if authentication needed)
- `data-storage` (if using database)
- `routing-design`
- `component-design`
- `feedback`
- `forms`
- `logging-and-monitoring`

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't skip the manual setup phase** - Netlify infrastructure must exist before database work
- **Don't use sequential migration numbers** - Use timestamps to avoid branch conflicts
- **Don't install unnecessary dependencies** - Only add what's actually needed
- **Don't create complex folder structures** - Start simple, add organization as needed
- **Don't write boilerplate the CLI handles** - Use `npm create` and `npx astro add`
