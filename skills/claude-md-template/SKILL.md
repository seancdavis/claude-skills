# CLAUDE.md Template Skill

This skill provides the template for generating `CLAUDE.md` files in new projects. The generated file serves as the project's primary context for Claude Code.

## Template Structure

The CLAUDE.md should be generated in the project root and customized based on:

- Framework choice (Astro vs Vite + React)
- Whether the project uses a database
- Whether the project requires authentication
- Any project-specific conventions

---

## Base Template

```markdown
# {PROJECT_NAME}

You are Sean's development partner on this project. Work collaboratively, make decisions within established patterns, and ask when something is ambiguous.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** {FRAMEWORK}
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Hosting:** Netlify
  {DATABASE_SECTION}
  {AUTH_SECTION}

## Commit Guidelines

- Make atomic commits with clear messages
- Use conventional commit format: `type: description`
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore
```

## Section Templates

### Framework: Astro

```markdown
- **Framework:** Astro with React components
```

Dev commands:

```markdown
\`\`\`bash

# Start dev server (wraps Astro with Netlify environment)

npm run dev # runs: netlify dev --no-open
\`\`\`
```

### Framework: Vite + React

```markdown
- **Framework:** Vite + React with React Router
```

Dev commands:

```markdown
\`\`\`bash

# Start dev server (Netlify Vite plugin injects environment)

npm run dev # runs: vite
\`\`\`
```

### Database Section

When using Netlify DB:

```markdown
- **Database:** Netlify DB (Neon) with Drizzle ORM
```

DB commands:

```markdown
\`\`\`bash

# Generate migration after schema changes

npm run db:generate

# Run migrations (preview branch)

npm run db:migrate

# Run migrations (production - requires confirmation)

npm run db:migrate:prod

# Open Drizzle Studio

npm run db:studio
\`\`\`
```

### Auth Section

When using Neon Auth:

```markdown
- **Auth:** Neon Auth with Google OAuth
```

### Skills List by Project Type

```markdown
- `/skills/astro-best-practices` - Astro patterns and conventions

```

**Vite + React with Database and Auth:**

```markdown
- `/skills/vite-best-practices` - Vite + React patterns
- `/skills/auth-design` - Authentication implementation
- `/skills/data-storage` - Database patterns with Drizzle
- `/skills/routing-design` - URL structure with React Router

## Project Conventions

- React components go in `src/components/`, organized by feature
- Astro pages in `src/pages/` handle routing and data fetching
- API routes in `src/pages/api/` return redirects with message keys
- Database schema in `db/schema.ts`
- Utility functions in `src/lib/`

## Generation Logic

When generating CLAUDE.md for a new project:

1. **Determine framework** from project setup decisions
2. **Include database section** if using Netlify DB
3. **Include auth section** if using Neon Auth
4. **Select relevant skills** based on project features
5. **Add project-specific conventions** based on folder structure

The new-project skill orchestrates this generation after scaffolding is complete.
